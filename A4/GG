# 🔥 R120 Wall Checker – Automating Fire-Resistance Verification in IFC Models
### *A BIM-based Python Tutorial using IfcOpenShell*

---

## 🧾 Summary  

**Short description (40 words):**  
This tutorial teaches how to use Python and the IfcOpenShell library to automatically verify fire-resistance (R120) compliance of load-bearing concrete walls from IFC models, according to Eurocode 2 (EN 1992-1-2).  

**Learning Level:** Level 2 — *Analyst / BIM Data Automation*  
**Focus Area:** BIM Use for Structural & Fire Safety Checking  

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives  

After completing this tutorial, you will be able to:  
1. Understand how to **extract and filter IFC wall data** using IfcOpenShell.  
2. Automatically **identify load-bearing interior walls** from IFC attributes.  
3. Retrieve **concrete layer thickness and class** information from `IfcMaterialLayerSet`.  
4. Apply **Eurocode 2 R120 fire-resistance criteria** in Python.  
5. Interpret and document the **PASS / FAIL / UNKNOWN** results of a wall-by-wall check.  

---

## 🧠 Background & Motivation  

Fire-resistance checking of walls in BIM models is typically manual and time-consuming.  
By leveraging **IfcOpenShell**, we can automate this process and ensure consistent verification across models.  
This tool responds to a learning need for *BIM analysts* to connect **model information (IFC)** with **regulatory performance requirements** (Eurocode 2).
